<a href='https://sites.google.com/view/ukpew2019/home' target='_blank'>35th Annual UK Performance Engineering Workshop (UKPEW 2019)</a>

The UK Performance Engineering Workshop (UKPEW) is an annual event that aims to gather researchers working on all aspects of performance modelling and analysis. ([Workshop Proceedings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4jeyFGqrzyg9P_-jXxxdzQFsAoDewNb))

We solicit original papers on performance evaluation techniques for computer and telecommunication systems analysis. Papers on or related to the following topics are particularly welcome.

* Performance-oriented design and analysis methods
* Formal modelling paradigms: stochastic process algebra, stochastic Petri nets, stochastic automata networks, Markov chains, queueing theory,...
* Solution and simplification techniques for stochastic processes
* Model checking and validation
* Approximate results for Markov and semi-Markov Processes
* Simulation techniques and experimental design
* Benchmarks and benchmark evaluation
* Performance tools
* Performance case studies
* Performability modelling
* Software performance engineering
* Performance and power consumption tradeoffs
* Performance overhead of secure systems
* New frontiers of performance evaluation/modelling
* Performance analysis of communication networks, mobile and wireless networks, software systems, distributed systems, system architectures, embedded systems, web-based systems, cloud computing, edge computing
